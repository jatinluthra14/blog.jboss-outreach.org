I  attended a webinar by the Red Hat on the topic,  [**Transitioning From Traditional to Cloud-Creative Development With `Red Hat OpenShift Application Runtimes`**](https://onlinexperiences.com/Launch/Event.htm?ShowKey=46769).

## Who was the host?
This webinar was given by *Syed Rasheed*

### What Is RHOAR
 The main topic of presentation was `Red Hat OpenShift Application Runtimes` (RHOAR), which is a collection of **cloud-native** runtimes for developing Java or JavaScript applications on `OpenShift` platform by Red Hat.
 
 It provides portability across multiple cloud infrastructures, allowing the developer to use microservices, containers, and DevOps automation.

## Knowledge gained
	I gained information about many Application runtimes and projects like Vert.x toolkit, Wildfly Swarm etc.
	I learned a lot about the transition, microservices and DevOps automation

## Question that I asked :-

Q. Can any java app be converted to Wildfly Swarm ?

A. Yes most of the java apps can be converted to use Wildfly Swarm and this transition is possible.

## Experience
	I was not new but quite beginner to all these things and thanks to Syed Rasheed for making me understand it.
